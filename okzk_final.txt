Read a recent interesting paper (within about two years from now) that utilizes deep learning preferably in your research field. Please summarize the paper in the following format with slides of 9-13 pages long.

1. Title page (authors, title, journal/conference name, page numbers, year of the paper as well as your name and student ID)
2. Summary of the work (what is the paper about?)
3. Background of the work (are there any previous attempts?)
4. Issues to solve (what are the issues in the previous work?)
5. The core idea(s) of the work (how does the work solve the issues?)
6. Explanation of the deep learning architecture
7. Evidence of its contribution(s) (how does the work demonstrate the contribution(s)?)
8. Possible applications (how are the contributions of the work generalized?)
9. Your thoughts (why do you find this paper interesting?)

Please consider the following aspects when choosing a paper

+ Choose an interesting paper that you want to share with others
+ Do not choose a paper written by your close researchers (e.g., in the same/previous laboratory)
+ Do not choose a paper that is shorter than four pages
+ If you have no idea how to choose a paper, it may be a good idea to check the proceedings of these conferences:
